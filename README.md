# inspector-to-sqs
This project provides a Python script that retrieves AWS Inspector V2 findings and sends them as JSON messages to an AWS SQS queue. The script allows configuration of the SQS queue name, target AWS account, and filtering criteria (severity and resource type) via a local configuration file.
